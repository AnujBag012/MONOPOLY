Welcome to the Monopoly Game powered by HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Gemini API! This project brings a fun and interactive twist to the classic Monopoly game by integrating 
AI-generated questions for a more dynamic experience.

Technologies Used:
  Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

API Configuration: It's better to use your own API Key to avoid traffic congestion and smoother experience.
  To use the Gemini API:
  Obtain an API key from Google Gemini.
  Add the API key in your JavaScript file:
  const GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here';
  Call the API for generating questions dynamically.
